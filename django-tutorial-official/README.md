# Official Tutorial - Poll Application
I am learning django by following the official [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/) from version 5 of the Django documentation to create a Poll Application.

## What I learned
- **Creating Projects** - If you do not specify the `.` at the end of the command, you will have a nested folder structure. I prefer the non-nested version, since there is less redundancy. I created the project in root due to personal preference here as well. 
>Personally, I am not a fan of the commands to create projects and applications, sounds a little weird. I would have preferred if they were `createproject` `createapp` instead of `startproject` `startapp`, however I am sure there must be some valid reason why it is this way.
